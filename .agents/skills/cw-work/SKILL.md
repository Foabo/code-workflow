Use this skill when the user asks Codex to run `cw-work` or the matching CW workflow action in this repository.

Before acting, read the repository's `.cw` files relevant to the current task. Treat `.cw` as Repo Truth, generated skills as invocation surfaces, and Git as the source of truth for code changes.

# cw-work

Default task progress action. Create or select a task, advance the next responsible phase, run check when appropriate, then stop before finish.

## Required Reading

- .cw/version.json
- .cw/project/overview.md
- .cw/project/architecture.md
- .cw/project/rules.md
- .cw/project/commands.md
- Current task files under .cw/tasks/<task-id>/ when a task exists

## Rules

- Treat .cw task files and project baseline files as repo truth for workflow facts.
- Use Git as the source of truth for code changes.
- Use cw internal helpers for deterministic task state changes and trace events.
- Keep edits scoped to the current workflow action.
- Stop for user judgment when requirements, product behavior, destructive worktree handling, workflow overrides, or baseline promotion need confirmation.
- If a subagent, skill, hook, MCP tool, or code intelligence tool is unavailable, continue inline when responsible.

## Execution Strategy Guidance

- Inline execution is fully supported and must remain complete.
- Hybrid execution is recommended when the harness supports delegation: keep coordination in the main session while delegating implementation or checking.
- Subagents receive task artifacts, relevant Project Baseline files, and necessary code context rather than full chat history.
- Implementer subagents may write code and update checklist progress, but must not close tasks.
- Checker subagents must return spec drift or product behavior changes to the main session for user confirmation.

## Workflow Steps

1. Run `cw preflight --action work`.
2. If no task exists, create one with `cw internal create-task --title <title>` after deriving a clear title from the user request.
3. Select the task with `cw internal select-task` or `cw internal select-task --task <task-id>`.
4. Read spec.md, plan.md, task.md, and relevant project baseline files.
5. If the task needs clarification, follow cw-clarify behavior.
6. If planning is missing or stale, follow cw-plan behavior.
7. If executable checklist items exist, follow cw-run behavior.
8. Run cw-check behavior when implementation appears complete.
9. When check passes, stop and ask whether to run cw-finish.
